Detecting fraud using machine learning

***
Fraud detection using machine learning is a technique that uses algorithms and statistical models to identify fraudulent activities in financial transactions, healthcare claims, insurance claims, and other areas.

Machine learning algorithms can learn from patterns in data and use this knowledge to detect anomalies or outliers that may indicate fraudulent behavior. These algorithms can be trained using historical data, including labeled data with known fraudulent transactions, to build models that can accurately detect and prevent fraud in real-time.
